# Overview

This R code appears is an analysis of ridership data for different modes of transportation (such as buses, LRT, MRT, Monorail, KTM, Shuttle) over the years 2019 to 2023. The analysis involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and linear regression modeling. 

# Conclusion

Overall, the code provides a comprehensive analysis of public transportation ridership trends, explores different modes of transportation, and predicts future ridership based on linear regression models, considering both with and without early months' data (potentially influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic).
